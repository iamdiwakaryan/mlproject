# ðŸ§  Student Performance Prediction - ML Pipeline

This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict student academic performance based on various input features (e.g., study time, absences, prior grades). It is modular, production-ready, and includes a **Flask web application** for real-time prediction.

Achieved **88% accuracy** using optimized models and thorough preprocessing.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, Scikit-learn**
- **Flask** 
- **VSCode, Jupyter** (for development)
